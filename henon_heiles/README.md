Analysis of the Henon-Heiles system

In this project, I will analyse the Henon Heiles system, given by

$$H=\frac1 2 (P^2+p^2) + V(x, y)$$

$$V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}(Q^2 + q^2 + 2Q^2q - \frac{2}{3}q^3)$$ 

with the following tools:

Contour plot of the potential,integration of the equation of motion, finding the intersections of trajectories with Q = 0 and P > 0 (points of the Poincare map), drawing the Poincare map, calculating the (one dimensional) lyapunov exponent for E = 1/6 in the chaotic regime. Further, there is a program the draws a return map $$q_{N+1}(q_{n})$$, and one to test different integration methods.
